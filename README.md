**Behavior Cloning** 

### Introduction


Behavior Cloning project requires to clone user's driving behavior on simulated training tracks and use the track image data to predict the steering angle. Cloned driver is able to use the predicted steering angle to navigate through the testing tracks. There are two track provided for the training track - Basic track and jungle track. Data from both the tracks were used for training. Below are the steps performed to clone the driving behavior:

*	Exploratory Data Analysis
*	Data Pre-processing
*	Data Augmentation
*	Build Convolutitional Neural Network Architecture
*	Train, validate, test and fine tune model and Network architecture
*	Use the trained model to predict the steering angle and navigate through the tracks
